<H1>Homeopathy!!</H1>
<P><STRONG>What is Homeopathy? </STRONG><BR>Homeopathy (=homeopathy) is an alternative method of treatment, based on the nature's law of Cure, namely 'Like Cures Like'. The truth of this law was discovered by a German scientist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, and has been verified experimentally and clinically for 200 years. Homeopathy is the revolutionary, natural medical science. Homeopathy is gentle and effective system of medicine. The remedies are prepared from natural substances to precise standards and work by stimulating the body's own healing power. 
</SPAN>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="1">Why should homeopathy be the choice of therapy?</a></STRONG> <BR>Homeopathy is scientific, logical, safe, quick and extremely effective method of healing. It offers long lasting to permanent cure, treating the disease from its roots, for most of the ailments. Homeopathy is one of the most rational sciences with respect to its concepts of health, disease and cure. Homeopathy does not treat superficially by just driving away the symptoms but heals the patient from within. Undoubtedly, homeopathy is the medicine of future.<BR> 
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="2">Homeopathy: Holistic Medicine:</a></STRONG> <BR>The concept of disease in homeopathy is that disease is a total affection of mind and body, the disturbance of the whole organism. Individual organs are not the cause of illness but disturbance at the inner level (disturbance of the life force, the vital energy of the body) is the cause of illness. Therefore homeopathy does not believe in giving different medicines for different afflicted parts of body but rather give one single constitutional remedy, which will cover the disturbance of the whole person. Homeopathy treats the patient as a whole and not just the disease. Medical philosophy is coming more and more to the conclusion that the mere treatment of symptoms and organs can only help temporarily and that it is the healing power of the body as whole that has to be enhanced. Homeopathy believes in holistic, totalistic and individualistic approach. 
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="3">Homeopathy: Magic of Minimum dose:</a></STRONG><BR>Homeopathy has a unique approach of the method of preparation of the drugs in which the end result will contain only the 'dynamic curative power' of the drug substance, devoid of any original crude substance. By a special mode of preparation called 'potentization', over 2500 homeopathic medicines are prepared from sources such as vegetables, animal, minerals, chemicals, etc. Hence homeopathic remedies with its ultra minute dose are non-toxic, absolutely harmless and bring about safe and sure cure. Homeopathic remedies are dynamic agents influencing body's energy.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="4">Homeopathy: Ideal for Infants and Children:</a></STRONG><BR>Most of the children ailments like Cold, Cough, Fever, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Dysentery, Colic, Tonsillitis, Bronchitis, Asthma, Measles, Chickenpox, Mumps, Dentition problems, etc., could be very effectively and quickly treated with homeopathy without producing any side effects whatsoever. Unlike antibiotics and other such medicines, homeopathic pills do not hamper digestion, or lower body's resistance. Neither do they cause any allergies nor cause any damage even if taken over a long period. Children, willingly ingest homeopathic pills being sweet in taste. Indeed, homeopathy is child-friendly! Besides, homeopathy is effective also in temperament and behavioral problems seen commonly in children like irritability, obstinacy, temper-tantrums, fears, phobias, destructiveness; and thumb- sucking, nail biting, bed-wetting; as well as in mentally and physically backward children.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="5">Homeopathy: Better substitute to Antibiotics...</a></STRONG><BR>Homeopathy is an effective alternate to antibiotics in infectious diseases, producing no toxic side effects and bringing about rapid recovery. Homeopathy has definite treatment for most of the infectious disease such as Sinusitis, Tonsillitis, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Meningitis, Otitis media (pus from ear), Gastroenteritis (vomiting-diarrhea), Dysentery, Urinary Infections, etc.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="6">Homeopathy offers wonder treatment for Viral infections:</a></STRONG><BR>Viral infections such as common cold, influenza, measles, chickenpox, mumps, viral hepatitis (jaundice), viral meningitis etc. are very well treated with homeopathy Allopathic system has no curative treatment for viral diseases except infusing antibiotics under the pretext of preventing secondary bacterial infection.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="7">Homeopathy: Often avoids Surgery</a></STRONG><BR>Homeopathy is not against surgery. Surgery is an art and science by itself. Surgery is called forth in the conditions where medicines have limited or no role, and where surgical aid, operation can cure or improve the condition. There are number of diseases which are labeled as 'surgical', where homeopathy works curatively and can avoid surgery. Some such ailments are: Septic recurrent Tonsillitis, Piles, Fissure-in-ano, Fistula, Appendicitis (except gangrenous), Chronic ear discharge, Vocal cord nodules, Polyp in nose-ear, Kidney & Biliary (small) stones, small size Uterine Fibroid, Ovarian Cysts, Warts, Corns, etc.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="8">Homeopathy: Answer to Allergic diseases</a></STRONG><BR>In modern life infections have diminished and various allergic disorders have grown rampant. Homeopathyoffers very effective treatment in all allergic diseases such as various skin diseases like Urticaria, Eczema,Contact Dermatitis, as well as gives unbelievably miraculous results in Asthmatic Bronchitis.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="9">Homeopathy: Excellent for Psychosomatic ailments</a> </STRONG><BR>The psychosomatic disorders like Migraine, Asthma, Acidity, Peptic ulcer, Allergy, Ulcerative colitis, etc. are successfully treated with homeopathy. Homeopathy has long recognized the psychological origin of somatic (body) symptoms. Homeopathy always examines patient's mental make-up in all cases and remedies are given acting at the level of mind and body together, thus eradicating the disease.<br><BR>Perhaps no other system of medicine has such a superb approach of tackling the mind-body disorders with definite therapeutic agents. Homeopathic remedies are capable of influencing the state of mind. They can specifically act to alleviate emotional disturbance such as excessive anxiety, irritability, insecurity, obsessive traits, undue jealousy, suspicion (paranoid) fears, depression, neurosis etc. By relieving the emotions such as above, homeopathic remedies bring about harmonious state of health. Thus homeopathy demonstrates the possibility of the highest goal of medicine, the therapy for the person rather than for the disease alone. Homeopathic remedies can treat mental and emotional disturbed states. <BR>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="10">Homeopathic Opinion: A must...</a></STRONG><BR>In this scientific era of health consciousness, the time has come that for the treatment of any disease, which does not respond to any particular line of treatment, one must take a homeopathic opinion immediately. Often patients lose their early time going to one specialist to another helplessly, without permanent relief, and approach homeopathy only when other medicines fail.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="11">Homeopathy: Not a last Resort</a></STRONG><BR>To obtain the best results and full benefits of homeopathic science, one should resort to homeopathy in the early phase of sickness. Because of ignorance and lack of awareness in general public about the usefulness of homeopathy in all kinds of diseases ranging from Cold to Cancer, many patients approach homeopathy late. By this time the disease process advances to an incurable stage and homeopathy can offer little then, to the otherwise curable disorders. However timely given homeopathic treatment could be a blessing to the ailing humanity.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="12">Homeopathy: A near complete system of medicine:</a></STRONG><BR>Homeopathy is not limited to certain diseases but is universally applicable to all kinds of diseases. It is time, when people must be made fully aware of the benefits and the scope of homeopathy in various day-to-day diseases. Homeopathy should be more and more made available to the benefit of ailing persons, as it can positively help 90% of the diseases we have today.<br>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="13">How does the practitioner know my remedy is working?</a></STRONG><BR>In assessing clients’ reactions to constitutional remedies, homeopaths are guided by Hering’s Law of Cure, named after Dr. Constantine Hering, an American homeopath. Its first and most reliable principle is that healing proceeds from the inside out, from the most important internal organs out to the skin. Even before you notice a measurable difference in your physical symptoms, you may experience an increase in well-being, optimism, and energy within days or weeks of taking a well-chosen remedy. The mind is of central importance, and this is a signal that healing has begun from within.<br><BR>The second principle of Hering’s Law of Cure is that healing proceeds from the top down. Although not always true in practice, stiffness and pain in the upper body may lessen before improvement is noticed in the lower extremities and joints. You may find your headaches improve, while your knee pain remains the same or temporarily worsens before later improving.<BR><BR>The final principle is that symptoms disappear in reverse order of their appearance. If you had severe eczema as a baby, then developed bronchitis, then asthma, you usually find your asthma symptoms improve first. You may then develop a bronchial cough which, if it runs its course without antibiotic suppression, will no longer be a common winter occurrence. Old skin symptoms of eczema may then reappear. If cortisone and similar suppressive treatments are avoided, your body will eventually heal itself of this more superficial, although unpleasant, symptom. In the meantime, you enjoy heightened energy and well-being, as well as overall better health and ease in your daily life.<BR>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="14">How is homeopathy different from naturopathy?</a></STRONG><BR>Both homeopaths and naturopaths study physical and medical sciences, including anatomy and pathology. High quality training programs are about four years in length and include professional ethics and supervised clinical experience with clients. In addition, naturopaths study homeopathy, acupuncture, nutrition, herbalism, and a variety of other healing modalities. By contrast, homeopaths study in depth a wide variety of remedies (Materia Medica), repertory, homeopathic philosophy and history, miasmatic theory, case-taking, case analysis, and case management. To use a medical analogy, a naturopath is somewhat similar to a family practitioner or internist, and a homeopath is somewhat similar to a specialist. <BR>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="15">Do I have to give up coffee and peppermint toothpaste?</a></STRONG><BR>Coffee (either regular or decaf) in moderation (1-2 cups per day) does not usually interfere with the action of homeopathic remedies. If you are very sensitive to coffee, you may want to limit its use for reasons other than its possible interference with homeopathy. If needed, remedies can be taken daily in liquid form by people who drink a lot of coffee. Peppermint-flavored toothpaste, foods, and teas generally do not interfere with remedy action, but you may want to avoid peppermint-flavored Altoids. Black, green, or herbal teas and other caffeinated drinks do not interfere with remedies.<BR>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="16">What kinds of things may interfere with the action of homeopathic remedies?</a></STRONG><BR>Using substances with camphor such as Tiger Balm, Noxzema, Vicks, and Carmex lip balm; using tea tree oil; sleeping all night with electric blankets,  heating pads, or heated waterbeds; exposing remedies to direct sunlight or extreme heat such as a closed car on a hot summer day or to strong X-rays such as those airlines use for checked baggage; touching remedies with your hands; or undergoing dental work with drilling and chemicals may interfere with the action or potency of homeopathic remedies. Be sure to store all homeopathic remedies away from microwave ovens, computers, TVs, and other electromagnetic devices. Talk with your practitioner if any of these factors may be affecting your response to homeopathy.<BR>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="17">Do I have to be off all other medications or supplements for homeopathy to work?</a></STRONG><BR>No, homeopathy works at the energetic level, on a different plane from conventional medications or supplements, which work at the material level. Homeopathy will not interfere with any medications you are currently taking. It is important, however, to inform your homeopath of all current medications and supplements you are taking, so your remedy dosing can be adjusted to be most effective. You should not discontinue any prescribed medications without first consulting your doctor.<BR>
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="18">Will I have to keep seeing my homeopath frequently for an extended period of time or years?</a> </STRONG><BR>This varies by individual. Homeopathy works by stimulating the body-mind to heal itself and come back into balance, and each person’s response to a remedy is unique. For best results with recurrent or chronic conditions, you should plan on seeing your practitioner for 30-60 minute follow-up appointments every 4-8 weeks for six months to one year. The purpose of these appointments is to ensure that your remedy is right for you, working well, and being taken at the optimal potency and frequency. After several months on a well-chosen remedy, clients are usually familiar enough with the subtle but powerful way homeopathy works and can simply schedule appointments as needed. If you have very complex and long-standing symptoms, you may need to continue to see your homeopath every 8-10 weeks until you feel such frequency is no longer necessary.<BR><BR>For acute conditions, such as influenza or an ear infection, a half-hour phone consult with your practitioner and a well-chosen remedy can produce results in minutes, hours, or days.<BR>  
<P class=normaltext align=justify><STRONG><BR><a name="19">Does homeopathy work with animals?</a></STRONG><BR>Yes, homeopathy works beautifully with animals. Both practitioners at our clinic enjoy and have experience working with animals. Between the two of us, we have worked with horses, birds, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and others. As with humans, acute conditions of animals generally respond more quickly than chronic or recurrent conditions, and homeopathic remedies do not interfere with any medications prescribed by veterinarians. After the intake appointment and one or two follow-ups by phone or in person, you can usually take over the care of your animal, calling your practitioner with any questions.<BR>
